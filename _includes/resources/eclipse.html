<p>{{site.title}} uses the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for developing Java code. Eclipse is favored as a
premier tool in academia and industry. A standard installation of Eclipse is available on all CS Department Linux computers 
for use by CS163/4 students. As a default, it will be assumed that students use this version on CS Department Machines. 
Basics of how to use the Eclipse IDE productively will be covered somewhat in lecture and more extensively in course 
recitations. Lab machines are currently using the Oxygen version of Eclipse, which is version 4.7.2. Eclipse 
    documentation is found <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/documentation/">here</a></p>

<p>Eclipse can also be downloaded for free and installed on most platforms. Eclipse is written entirely in Java, so it will operate
properly on most any platforms that support Java. This includes Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X and properly configured 
Windows platforms. It is assumed that many students will find it possible to install and use Eclipse on their own computers, and the instructor and GTAs will try to help informally. However, successful installation and use of tools such as Eclipse on your own machine demands some understanding of how to install and use new software on that platform, and ultimately it falls to the individual student to either succeed at such an effort or to use the resources already provided by the CS Department. The help that can be offered by the instructor and GTAs is by necessity limited.

<p>If you decide to run Eclipse on your system, make sure you download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK)
first from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">here</a>.
The current version of Java
on department systems is 1.8
(<a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html">Version 8</a>).
After installing Java, download and install Eclipse from
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">here</a>.
Select the version called Eclipse IDE for Java Developers. 
In both cases make sure you select the correct operating system.
