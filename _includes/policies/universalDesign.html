<p>We are committed to the principle of universal learning. This means that our classroom, our virtual
    spaces, our practices, and our interactions be as inclusive as possible. Mutual respect, civility, and
    the ability to listen and observe others carefully are crucial to universal learning.</p>

<p>If you are a student who will need accommodations in this class, please contact me to discuss
    your individual needs. Any accommodation must be discussed in a timely manner. A verifying
    memo from <a href="https://disabilitycenter.colostate.edu/">The Student Disability Center</a>
    may be required before any accommodation is
    provided.</p>

<p>The Student Disability Center (SDC) has the authority to verify and confirm the eligibility of
    students with disabilities for the majority of accommodations. While some accommodations may
    be provided by other departments, a student is not automatically eligible for those
    accommodations unless their disability can be verified and the need for the accommodation
    confirmed, either through SDC or through acceptable means defined by the particular
    department. Faculty and staff may consult with the SDC staff whenever there is doubt as to the
    appropriateness of an accommodative request by a student with a disability.</p>

<p>The goal of SDC is to normalize disability as part of the culture of diversity at Colorado State
    University. The characteristic of having a disability simply provides the basis of the support that
    is available to students. The goal is to ensure students with disabilities have the opportunity to
    be as successful as they have the capability to be.</p>

<p>Support and services are offered to student with functional limitations due to visual, hearing,
    learning, or mobility disabilities as well as to students who have specific physical or mental health
    conditions due to epilepsy, diabetes, asthma, AIDS, psychiatric diagnoses, etc. Students who are
    temporarily disabled are also eligible for support and assistance.</p>

<p>Any student who is enrolled at CSU, and who self-identifies with SDC as having a disability, is
    eligible for support from SDC. Specific accommodations are determined individually for each
    student and must be supported by appropriate documentation and/or evaluation of needs
    consistent with a particular type of disability. SDC reserves the right to ask for any appropriate
    documentation of disability in order to determine a student’s eligibility for accommodations as
    well as in support for specific accommodative requests. The accommodative process begins once
    a student meets with an accommodation’s specialist in the SDC.</p>
